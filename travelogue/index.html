                    <h2>Taipei 101</h2>
                    <h3>Taipei, Taiwan</h3>
                    <p>This photo was taken way back in 2018. I have been to Taipei a couple of times when I was younger
                        since my father has been working there as an electrical engineer, way before I was born.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose this specific moment as this was the first time the whole family was complete in an
                        international travel. We've been to different countries before but mostly separate as our
                        parents are busy bees and if we have the opportunity to come with them for travel our school and
                        for me that time my work schedule doesn't align most of the time.
                        <br><br>
                        I personally enjoyed our overall trip during this time and it was especially memorable because
                        it is the rare occasion when everything just aligned perfectly. The excitement of all being
                        together in a different country, experiencing Taipei's culture and sights for the first time as
                        a complete family, was a feeling I won't forget. It was not just about visiting a place; it was
                        about sharing moments that we had all missed and took for granted in the past.

                    <h2>Boracay Island</h2>
                    <h3>Aklan, Philippines</h3>
                    <p>The island of Boracay is known for its pristine white-sand beaches and crystal-clear waters. It
                        is also one of the best travel destinations in the Philippines. Funnily enough, this was my
                        first time visiting the island in my 27 years of existence.
                        <br><br>
                        In the photo, we had just finished our "Flying Donut Water Tubing" experience—it was
                        breathtaking, to say the least. The rush of adrenaline coursing through our bodies every time
                        the speedboat made a sharp turn was exhilarating. The thought that we might end up swimming for
                        our lives if we loosened our grip for even a moment added a thrilling sense of adventure! I
                        don’t usually participate in extreme activities, as I am generally a cautious person. However,
                        since this will be my last outing with my closest friends for a while, they made sure to give me
                        an unforgettable experience before I moved to Canada.
                        <br><br>
                        It was a memorable moment for all of us. We’ve been great friends for more than a decade, and
                        this was the first time we put a little more effort into planning an out-of-town trip. We still
                        talk about our adventure poke fun of each other and can’t wait to plan our next one when I go
                        back home for vacation.

                    <h2>Drumheller</h2>
                    <h3>Drumheller, Alberta</h3>
                    <p>LVisiting Drumheller, famously known as the "Dinosaur Capital of the World," was like stepping
                        into a time machine. I've always been fascinated by dinosaurs as a kid, so being surrounded by
                        real fossils and learning about prehistoric life felt like a childhood dream come true.
                        <br><br>
                        I went there with my girlfriend and her siblings, and it turned out to be one of the most
                        enjoyable experiences I've ever had! Exploring the Royal Tyrrell Museum was an absolute
                        highlight for us. The towering skeletons of dinosaurs up close was unreal and fascinating at the
                        same time. Every exhibit, halls and floors were really informative.
                        <br><br>
                        But what made the trip special for me was the company. Sharing this experience with my
                        girlfriend and her siblings made it all the more memorable. We enjoyed, learned, and made
                        memories that will last a lifetime. It's a great bonding experience overall.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I can say that Drumheller wasn’t just a destination, it was an adventure, also to add
                        the I can’t wait to visit Last Chance Saloon as well! The local beer and ribs were the perfect
                        pair. It's just sad they don't sell the local beer outside Drumheller though.
